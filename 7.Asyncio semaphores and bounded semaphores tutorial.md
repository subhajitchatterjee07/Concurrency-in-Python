# Asyncio Semaphores and Bounded Semaphores 

## What are semaphores?

Semaphores were originally a key part of railway system architecture and it was Dijkstra that that translated this problem to computing world.

These semaphores have an internal counter that is incremented or decremented whenever either an acquire or release call is made.

Say we protected a block of code with a semaphore, and the initial value is set to 2. If one worker acquired the semaphore, the value of semaphore would be decremented by 1. If 2nd worker comes, it will again be decremented.

At this point if another worker comes along and tries to acquire the semaphore it will be denied.
The value of these semaphores is that they allow us to protect resources from being overused.


## Implementation
See example 7.1

## Bounded semaphores
There lies a very subtle difference between a normal semaphore and a bounded semaphore. A bounded semaphore only differs in terms of not allowing more releases than the acquires. If it does exceed the value then a valueError is raised.
