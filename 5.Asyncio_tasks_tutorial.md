# Asyncio Tasks Tutorial

## Tasks
Tasks within Asyncio are responsible for the execution of coroutines within an event loop at one time and in order to achieve parallel execution you would have to run multiple event loops over multiple threads.



One of the key things to note about tasks in Asyncio is that you don't directly create them, you instead use the ensure_future() function or the 'AbstractEventLoop.create_task() method()' method.
Let's take a quick look at how we can use a task generator function in order to generate 5 distinct tasks for our event loop to process.

See example 5.1

## The all_tasks(loop=None) method:

Being able to ascertain what tasks are currently pending can be important for systems in production needing to be able to anticipate things such as workload etc. The all_tasks() method gives us some incite as to what tasks are currently in a pending state before they are executed by our event loop.

See example 5.2

## The cancel() function
Being able to effectively cancel pending tasks can be useful in scenarios where you are rate limiting the number of tasks being executed, or if you are trying to rate limit the application. Thankfully the asyncio API provides the necessary functionality for this to be done relatively easily.

See example 5.3


# Task functions()

## The as_completed() function
Interact with the tasks as a collective.

Example 5.4

## The gather() function
The gather() function returns one single future that aggregates all of the results from the given coroutines or futures passed into it. You should note that the results are not returned in the order they were submitted so if you care about it then you will have to implement some admin functionality to reorder results.

Example 5.5

## The wait() function

The wait function simply blocks until the future instances passed into it complete, upon completion this will then return a named 2-tuple of sets. The first set contains futures that have completed, the second gives the uncompleted futures. This can be useful in scenarios where you have to process a task within a given time, say you were making a number of REST API calls or pulling messages from a queue on a broker, if they failed to complete within the complete within the timeout you could possibly try to process them in a different way.
