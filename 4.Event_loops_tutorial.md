# Asyncio Event Loops Tutorial

## The Event Loop 

The main component of any asyncio based Python program has to be the underlying event loop. 

Within this event loop we can (from the official docs):
1. register, execute and cancel calls
Launch subprocesses and the associated transports with an external program
3. Delegate costly function calls to a pool of threads

Essentially all an event loop does is wait for events to happen efore matching each event to a function that we have an explicitly matched with said type of event.

A good example is a web server, say we have an endpoint on our server that serves our website which features a multitude of different pages. Our event loop essentially listens for requests to be made and then matches each of these requests to its associated webpage.

Each of the requests made to our web server in the above example would be considered a separate event. These events would be then matched to a set function that we have predefined whenever a said event is triggered.

## Getting Started

See example-3.1

### Running Options
We have a number of options for running our event loops, we can either call 'run_forever()' which is subsequently run our event loop until the stop() function is called, or we call run_until_complete(future) and only run our event loop until whatever future object we've passed in has completed its execution.

### The run_until_complete() method

See the example 4.1

### The run_forever() method

The alternate way of starting up your event loop and have it run indefinitely until the program comes to an end or the stop() method is called. It should be noted that calling this blocks our main thread to block indefinitely.

See Example 4.2

## Running Multiple coroutines:
If you wanted to run multiple coroutines indefinitely in parallel then you can do that by creating x number of coroutines and have them run on a while loop each. You would then call 'asyncio.ensure_future(function()) in order to enqueue them onto loop and they would run indefinitely after that point.
