# Asyncio Synchronization Primitives - Queues and Locks

## Why are these important?
When it comes to programming concurrent systems you have to try and ensure that your program is free from race conditions. A race condition occurs when multiple concurrent workers whn multiple concurrent workers try to modify a shared variable concurrently and they start to produce erroneous results due to timing issues.

Because of these race conditions we have to utilize things known as synchronization primitives. When it comes to synchronization primitives within asyncio we have a number to choose from. These are based on the threading module equivalent and tend to have the same API with which we can work on them.

## Locks

The best analogy to describe how a lock works is to imagine there is a queue of people trying to access a bathroom. One person goes in and locks the door and in doing so prevents another person from coming in whilst they are doing their business.

Ex- 6.1  A simple example of a lock.


## Queues
When it comes to communicating in a synchronized fashion, then asyncio provides its own queue based implementation. We can push things onto our queue in a synchronized fashion with a producer and have consumers simultaneously poll this queue for anything pushed onto it.


Ex- 6.2 for simple queue implementation.
