# Event-driven programming using RxPY

Event driven programming can dynamically react to different situations in smart ways and the ReactiveX library enables to do this in such a way that our code is succinct and easy to follow.

## Difference between Reactive and Event-driven programming

It should be noted that there are some subtle differences between programming and reactive programming. Event-driven programming focuses on handling events such as,  for example, a button click and is the paradigm that most operating systems are based upon. If you perform an action within an operating system, the os will treat that as an event and trigger the corresponding function for that action.

Reactive programming on the other hand treats the data passed into reactive systems as events. You could have a reactive system listen for stock price changes and only trigger an action to happen when stock price reaches a certain price.

## Working with RxPY

We will develop this with a example.
Let's imagine that we are creating a stock trading system, that will buy and sell stocks depending on their price. We could have an array of stocks.

We then want to create an observable object that will emit events based on what the value of the stocks are. In this example we’ll define a buy_stock_events(observer) function which will iterate over our stocks array and call the on_next() function whenever the stock price is greater than 100.

Once we have done this we can fetch we can then subscribe to our source observable object. 

You’ll notice that we are passing in 3 distinct lambda functions into our call to subscribe(). These 3 lambda functions are on_next() which is called whenever our Observable emits something, on_completed() which is called when our Observable has nothing else to give us, and on_error() which is called whenever there is an error emitted by our Observable.
