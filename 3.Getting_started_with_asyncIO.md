# Getting started with asyncIO

AsyncIO allows us to easily write single-threaded concurrent programs that utilize something called as <b>coroutines</b>, these coroutines are like stripped down threads and don't come with the same inherit performance issues that full-fat threads typically come with.
//Need to know more details 

AsyncIO also does a very good job of abstracting away from us the complexities of things such as multiplexed I/O access over sockets and it also simplifies our jobs by providing an arsenal of synchronization primitives that helps to make our programs thread-safe.

## Getting started
In order to egt started with asyncio we require we require one crucial component, that is called as event loop.
The event loop schedules our asyncio.coroutines and handles all heavy lifting.

Example 3.1

## Coroutines
Coroutines are essentially lightweight versions of your more traditional threads. By using these we are essentially able to write asynchronous programs that are similar to threads but they run on the top of a single thread.
Coroutines are defined as: 

<code>
aync def myFunc1():
print("Coroutine1")
</code>

## Futures

Futures in asyncio are very much similar to the Future objects you would see within python TPEs or ProcessPoolExecutors and it follows an exact identical implementation. Future objects are created with the intention that they will eventually be given a result some time in future, hence the name. This is beneficial as it means that within your program you can go off and perform other tasks whilst you are waiting for your "future" to return a result.

Thankfully, working with futures is easy due to 'ensure_future()' method which takes in a coroutine and returns the Future version of that coroutine.

See Example 3.1

## Multiple Coroutines
Let's now try to take advantage of asyncio's ability to run multiple coroutines concurrently. This will help us create incredibly performant python programs running on a single thread.


Let's start by creating a simple coroutine that takes in an id as its primary parameter. This will generate a random integer called process_length and wait for that length of time. It will then print out its id and how long it waited for.

Next inside our main() method we will generate 10 tasks that and then await these tasks completion using await.asyncio.gather() function, passing in our list of tasks. Finally we'll utilize the same event loop from previous example to run the program.

See example 3.2

Our coroutines go off and execute concurrently and finish execution at different times. Itâ€™s important to note that these are not completed in the same order as they were submitted and if you were to time the execution of the above program, it would take just above 5 seconds to complete execution.
