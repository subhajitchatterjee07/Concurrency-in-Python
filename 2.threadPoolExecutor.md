# Python ThreadPoolExecutor

ThreadPoolExecutors provide a simple abstraction around spinning up multiple threads to perform tasks in a concurrent fashion. Adding threading to your application can help to drastically improve the speed of the application when used in the right context. By using multiple threads we can speed up applications which face an i/o based botleneck, a good example of this would be a web crawler.

Web crawlers typically do a lot of heavy i/o based tasks such as fetching and parsing websites, if we were to fetch every page in a synchronous fashion one would find the basic bottleneck for your program would be the fetching of these pages from the internet. By using something such as a ThreadPoolExecutor we can effectively mitigate this bottleneck by doing multiple fetches concurrently and processing each page as it returns.

## Creating a ThreadPoolExecutor
The first step we need to know is how we can define our own ThreadPoolExecutor's. This is a rather simple one-liner : 

<code>
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
</code>
Here we instantiate an instance of our ThreadPoolExecutor and pass in the maximum nmber of workers that we want it to have. In this case we've defined it as 3 which means this thread pool will only have 3 concurrent threads that can process any jobs that we submit to it.
In order to give the threads within the TPE something to do we can use the submit() function which takes in a function as its primary parameter like so:
<code>
executor.submit(muFunction())
</code>

## Example
in 2.1 an example is discussed
We utilize the <b>threading.current_thread()</b> function to determine which thread has done the task.


## Context Manager
The second and most popular method of instantiating a ThreadpoolExecutor is using it as a  context manager like so:
<code>
with ThreadPoolExecutor (max_workers=3) as executor:
</code>

## Example
This time we'll be defining a different task that takes in a variable 'n' as input just to give you a simple demonstration.
