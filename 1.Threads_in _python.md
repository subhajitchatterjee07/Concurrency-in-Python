# Threads In Python

Threads are ordered streams of instructions. These can be scheduled to run by the operating system and can be run in parallel across multiple cores or concurrently across a single core. 

Threads typically live within a parent process and typically consists of 4 things:
1. Program Counter
2. A stack
3. A set of registers
4. An identifier

Threads within an operating system are typically able to interact with shared resources and communication is indeed possible between multiple threads. As they are able to share resources such as memory, they are also able to modify things in a concurrent or even parallel fashion. However when 2 threads start modifying something in a concurrent fashion, it is important to note that if the guards and checks are not appropriate, there might be instances of race conditions. 
 
There are 2 distinct types of thread:
1. User level threads: These are the ones that are availed/used by the end user.
2. Kernel level threads: These are very low level threads that act on behalf of the operating system.


## Multithreading
When people typically talk about multithreaded processors, they are referring to a processor that can run multiple threads simultaneously. These would typically have 2 or more threads actively competing for executing for execution time within a core and when one thread gives up or stops, the processing core then starts to execute another thread. It context switches between these threads very quickly and gives of the impression that the computer is running things in parallel.


## Creating a simple thread
The python thread class constructor has the following parameters: 

<code>
## Python Thread Class Constructor 
</code> 

<code>
def __init__(self,group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs=None, verbose=None):

</code> 

It takes in 5 distinct parameters:
1. group: a special parameter which is reserved for future extension.
2. target: the callable object to be invoked by the run method(), if None then nothing will be started...
3. name: Our threads name 
4. args: argument tuple for target ivocation, defaults to ()
5. kwargs: dictionary keyword argument to invoke the base class constructor 

The key one to notice is the target parameter. In order to start a simple thread we need to pass it something to run.
